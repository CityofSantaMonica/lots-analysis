# lots-analysis

A project to analyze parking lot data in Santa Monica. 

The primary data source is the [City of Santa Monica's Open Data Portal](https://data.smgov.net),
and specifically the [Parking Lot Counts](https://data.smgov.net/Transportation/Parking-Lot-Counts/ng8m-khuz) dataset.

This dataset is fed a snapshot of the [current state of the parking lots](https://parking.api.smgov.net/lots) every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day.
